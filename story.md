# School Timetable Management System — DS Universe Story

In the world of EduVerse, every school struggled to create timetables because teachers, classes, and subjects were never in harmony. 
One day, three heroic Data Structure Guardians arrived to restore order to the system.

Ayma the Array appeared first — neat, organized, and structured. She arranged every teacher and class into perfect positions.  
Then came Hadia the Stack — powerful and disciplined. She protected the school schedules and used her LIFO magic to undo mistakes whenever they happened.  
Finally arrived Nosheen the Queue — calm and patient. She handled every class request in the exact order they came to keep scheduling fair.

Together they created the School Timetable Management System.  
Teachers entered the kingdom, classes lined up in a queue, and subjects were scheduled one by one using perfect logic.  
Whenever a mistake occurred, Stack Hadia stepped in to reverse the last assignment, restoring balance.  
Using their powers, the timetable was generated automatically, bringing peace and organization to EduVerse.

And this is how the Data Structure Heroes built a world where every class gets the right teacher at the right time.
