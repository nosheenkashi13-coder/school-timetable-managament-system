Name: Ayma
DS Character: Array Ayma
Role in Project: Idea Machine

I am Array Ayma — always organized and fixed in size! In our School Timetable Management System project, I contributed creative ideas for how teachers, subjects, and class schedules should be arranged clearly and efficiently. My structured thinking helped the team develop a balanced approach to weekly timetable design.
